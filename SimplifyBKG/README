Main goal of this project is to simplify given context-free grammar. Grammar can be read
from a file or stdin. Output of the project can be input grammar, grammar after step 1 of algorithm 
or grammar without unnescesary grammar rules. Which output is printed depends on chosen option. 

Program simplify-bkg is created using the command make which compiles project using ghc.
Then program is run using:
    ./simplify-bkg option [input-file]
Option can be:
    -i -> program validates input grammar and prints it
    -1 -> program executes first step of algorithm and prints the result
    -2 -> program simplifies input grammar and prints the result

Example of input grammar:
A,B,S
a,b
S
A->AB
B->b
S->A
S->a
